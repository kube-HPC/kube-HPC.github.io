Before you build your algorithm and push it to [docker registry](https://kube-hpc.github.io/api-server/docs.html), you first need to expose it to the outer world.   
Hkube communicate with your algorithm via websocket (native websocket or socketio).  
The algorithm should create a websocket client that listens to: ws://localhost:3000.

If you prefer to run your algorithm inside node, see this [node.js example](https://github.com/kube-HPC/algorithm-node-example)
