## Introduction
Hkube allows to view data generated by tensorflow of users algorithm in Tensorboard UI.

## Config

#### logdir
An algorithm using tensorflow generates tensorboard log data. In the algorithm code when creating Tensorboard object a logDir parameter is passed. For integration with Hkube the logDir value passed, must first be obtained from the environment variable : ALGO_METRICS_DIR.
	 
```python
log_dir = os.environ['ALGO_METRICS_DIR']
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)
model.fit(x=x_train,
          y=y_train,
          epochs=5,
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test),
          callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

#### Loading metrics in Tensorboard

In hkube ui pipelines tab, its possible to identify which pipeline have ran and created tensorboard metrics by the orange label "metrics"
Hovering over the actions icon pops up a "Create tensorboard for selected nodes" window. You can now select which nodes to create the tensorboard for, and click "create board".

Once board is created a label "boards" is added. Hovering over the "boards" pops up the link to the board displaying the data of the collected metrics.
